
<p>In an effort to help reduce waste going to landfills and to return nutrients back to our community we can provide a once a week pickup service for
	organic waste. This includes food leftovers, food waste, newspaper, coffee filters, cardboard boxes, yard waste, and animal waste. We will provide special
	waste carts where you can dispose of the organic materials. When we come by to collect the organic waste your used waste cart will be replaced with a fresh
	clean ones so that odors don't settle.</p>
<p>We provide this service for $20 a month or $200 a year. In addition we will offer a complimentary voucher for a 25 pound bag of fresh compost for every
	two months of service.</p>
