<p>We offer completely organic compost in various quantities to help make our communities green. Our compost is produced with a special aerobic technique to
	minimize methane and ammonia that is common in most compost. This maximizes the carbon in our compost and keeps the nitrogen fixed in the material as well to
	make a truly nutritious addition to any soil.</p>
<p>We have 2 different sizes of bag for compost. 25 pound bag for $6.00, 50 pound bag $10.00. We offer delivery for a small additional fee.</p>
